## Important Notes

### GoFile API Compatibility (2026 Update)

**Free downloads work — no premium account required.**

Earlier in 2026 GoFile started returning `error-notPremium` for free/guest
accounts, which looked like the API had been locked to premium users. The real
cause was different: GoFile moved the `X-Website-Token` from a **static** value
published in `config.js` (now a decoy) to a **dynamically generated** token
computed client-side. The old static token is simply rejected.

This app now reproduces that generation, so free downloads work again:

- ✅ **Dynamic website token**: `X-Website-Token` is computed as
  `sha256(userAgent::language::accountToken::timeWindow::salt)`, matching
  GoFile's own `wt.obf.js`. The `timeWindow` rotates every 4 hours.
- ✅ **Matching request headers**: The `User-Agent` and `X-BL` (language) headers
  sent on each request match the values hashed into the token (the server
  recomputes and validates it).
- ✅ **Rate-limit handling**: Guest content requests are rate-limited by GoFile;
  the app backs off and retries automatically.
- ✅ **Nested Folders**: Full support for deeply nested folder structures with UUID-based IDs
- ✅ **Special Characters**: Properly handles emoji and special characters in folder names
- ✅ **Password Protection**: Supports SHA-256 password hashing for protected content
- ✅ **Recursive Downloads**: Automatically traverses and downloads all subfolders

**If `error-notPremium` returns in the future**, GoFile has most likely rotated
the salt embedded in `wt.obf.js`. You can update it without a code change by
setting the `GOFILE_WT_SALT` environment variable (see the table below), or by
updating the tool. A premium token still works and bypasses guest rate limits.

### If `api.gofile.io` resets your connection (VPN / cloud / datacenter)

GoFile's API host filters traffic by TLS fingerprint and IP reputation. From
VPN, cloud or datacenter IPs it often **resets the connection** before any
response (you'll see a clear "GoFile reset the connection … This IP is blocked
by GoFile's API edge" message in the logs). This is a network-level block, not a
bug in this tool. To work around it:

1. **Run from a residential connection** (most reliable), or
2. **Set `GOFILE_PROXY`** to an HTTP/SOCKS proxy on a clean/residential IP:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - GOFILE_PROXY=socks5://user:pass@your-proxy:1080
   ```
3. `curl_cffi` (installed by default) presents a real Chrome TLS fingerprint,
   which helps when the block is fingerprint-based rather than pure IP.

File downloads go to GoFile's `store-*` servers (not `api.gofile.io`) and are
usually reachable even when the API host is blocked; `GOFILE_PROXY` applies to
those too.

### Premium Account Support

If you have a GoFile premium account, you can use your account token to bypass free account restrictions:

**Benefits of using a premium token:**

- Bypasses `error-notPremium` API restrictions
- Faster and more reliable downloads
- No need for web scraping fallback
- Direct API access

**How to use:**

1. **Find your token**: Log into your GoFile account at [gofile.io/myProfile](https://gofile.io/myProfile) and copy your account token

2. **Configure via environment variable** (Docker):

   ```yaml
   environment:
     - GOFILE_PREMIUM_TOKEN=your-premium-token-here
   ```

3. **Configure via config.yml** (non-Docker):

   ```yaml
   premium_token: "your-premium-token-here"
   ```

4. **Or enter per-download** in the web interface:
   - Click "Advanced Options" in the download form
   - Enter your token in the "GoFile Premium Account Token" field

**Note**: Tokens entered in the web UI override the config/environment variable for that specific download.

### Docker Volumes

GoFile Downloader uses the following volumes:

- `/data`: Main storage location for downloaded files
- `/config`: Persistent storage for download tracking files (incremental mode)

### Security Best Practices

For a secure deployment:

1. **Use Authentication**: Enable authentication by setting `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and setting a strong password
2. **Set a Custom Secret Key**: Provide a strong `SECRET_KEY` for sessions and CSRF protection
3. **Limit Network Access**: Consider running behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS
4. **Use Non-Root User**: The container already runs as non-root user `gofile`
5. **Keep Updated**: Regularly rebuild the container to get security updates

### Advanced Docker Configurations

#### With HTTPS Reverse Proxy (Traefik Example)

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  gofile-dl:
    image: ghcr.io/martadams89/gofile-dl:latest
    volumes:
      - ./downloads:/data
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      - AUTH_ENABLED=true
      - AUTH_USERNAME=admin
      - AUTH_PASSWORD=secure-password
      - CONFIG_DIR=/config
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.gofile.rule=Host(`gofile.example.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.gofile.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.gofile.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
    networks:
      - proxy
    restart: unless-stopped

networks:
  proxy:
    external: true
```

#### Resource-Limited Configuration

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  gofile-dl:
    image: ghcr.io/martadams89/gofile-dl:latest
    volumes:
      - ./downloads:/data
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      - PORT=2355
      - CONFIG_DIR=/config
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.50"
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          cpus: "0.25"
          memory: 128M
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Health Check and Monitoring

GoFile Downloader provides a health check endpoint at `/health` that returns system information and application
status in JSON format. This can be used by container orchestration tools to monitor the application's health.

Example health check response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": 1651234567.89,
  "system": {
    "system": "Linux",
    "python_version": "3.11.0",
    "cpu_usage": 5.2,
    "memory": {
      "total": 8589934592,
      "available": 4294967296,
      "percent": 50.0
    },
    "disk": {
      "total": 107374182400,
      "free": 53687091200,
      "percent": 50.0
    }
  },
  "application": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "active_tasks": 2,
    "version": "2.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Docker Deployment

1. **Container fails to start**
   - Check logs: `docker logs gofile-dl`
   - Verify environment variables are correctly set
   - Ensure the download directory has correct permissions

2. **Cannot access web interface**
   - Confirm port mapping: `docker ps`
   - Check if the host firewall allows access to the port
   - Verify the container is running: `docker ps | grep gofile-dl`

3. **Download files not appearing**
   - Check the volume mounting: `docker inspect gofile-dl`
   - Verify the BASE_DIR environment variable is set correctly
   - Check directory permissions
   - **Permission denied errors**: Ensure the mounted directory is writable by UID 1000 (default container user)

4. **Authentication issues**
   - Ensure AUTH_ENABLED is set to "true" (case-sensitive)
   - Verify username and password are correctly set
   - Clear browser cache and cookies

5. **GoFile download errors**
   - Error "Cannot get wt": GoFile may have updated their JavaScript structure. Check for application updates.
   - **Error "API error: error-notPremium"**: This means GoFile rejected the website token. It normally works out of the box; if it persists, GoFile has likely rotated the salt embedded in `wt.obf.js`. Set `GOFILE_WT_SALT` to the current value (or update the tool). A premium token also bypasses this.
   - **Error "error-rateLimit"**: GoFile rate-limits free/guest content requests. The app backs off and retries automatically; if it persists, wait a few minutes or use a premium token.
   - **Timeout errors (Read timed out)**: GoFile's API may be slow or overloaded. The app now uses 30-45 second timeouts and automatically retries 3 times. If timeouts persist, wait a few minutes and try again.
   - If web fallback fails: This may indicate GoFile has further changed their interface. Please check for updates or report the issue on GitHub.
   - Nested folders not downloading: Verify you're providing the top-level folder URL, not individual file links
   - Special characters in filenames: These are automatically sanitized - check the `downloads` folder for the
     converted names
   - Rate limiting: GoFile may rate limit API requests. Wait a few minutes and try again.

## Testing

### Running Tests

A test script is provided to verify GoFile connectivity:

```bash
# Test with environment variables
export GOFILE_TEST_URL="https://gofile.io/d/YOUR_CONTENT_ID"
export GOFILE_TEST_PASSWORD="your_password"  # Optional, only if content is password-protected
python test_gofile_api.py

# Or test directly with arguments
python test_gofile_api.py --url "https://gofile.io/d/YOUR_CONTENT_ID" --password "your_password"
```

The test script verifies:

- Token acquisition from GoFile API
- WebsiteToken (wt) extraction from config.js
- Content access with proper authentication
- Nested folder structure retrieval

## Use Case: Tracking Ongoing Series with Incremental Mode

The incremental/sync mode is perfect for content that updates regularly, such as TV series, podcast archives,
or any collection that receives periodic updates.

### Why Use Incremental Mode?

When downloading from ongoing series or regularly updated folders:

- Avoid re-downloading files you already have
- Save bandwidth and time
- Keep your local copy synchronized with the remote folder
- Handle folder renames automatically (common with "NEW FILES" prefixes)

### How It Works

1. **Initial Download**: Download the entire folder structure
   - Enable "Incremental/Sync mode" checkbox in the web UI
   - Or use `incremental=true` via API/curl

2. **Subsequent Updates**: Run the same download again
   - Only NEW files are downloaded
   - Previously downloaded files are automatically skipped
   - Handles folder renames with customizable pattern matching
   - Default patterns strip: `⭐NEW FILES in`, `NEW FILES in`, `⭐`

3. **Behind the Scenes**:
   - Creates persistent tracking file: `.gofile_tracker_<contentId>.json` in `/config`
   - Stores list of downloaded file IDs and names
   - Matches folders even when renamed using pattern normalization
   - Logs all skipped files for visibility

### Customizing Folder Patterns

Different uploaders use different naming conventions. You can customize the patterns to match your specific use case:

1. **Via Web UI**:
   - Click "Advanced Options" to reveal pattern configuration
   - Enter pipe-separated patterns: `⭐NEW FILES in |NEW FILES in |⭐`

2. **Via API/curl**:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:2355/start \
     -d "url=https://gofile.io/d/abc123" \
     -d "incremental=true" \
     -d "folder_pattern=UPDATED |⭐NEW |*NEW FILES in "
   ```

3. **Pattern Examples**:
   - `⭐NEW FILES in |NEW FILES in |⭐` (default) matches:
     - `⭐NEW FILES in Show S1 [10]` → `Show S1 [10]`
     - `NEW FILES in Episode Pack` → `Episode Pack`
   - `UPDATED |⭐NEW |*NEW FILES in ` matches:
     - `UPDATED Show S1` → `Show S1`
     - `⭐NEW Episode Pack` → `Episode Pack`
     - `*NEW FILES in Series` → `Series`

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Week 1: Initial download - gets everything
docker-compose exec gofile-dl curl -X POST http://localhost:2355/start \
  -d "url=https://gofile.io/d/abc123" \
  -d "incremental=true" \
  -d "folder_pattern=⭐NEW FILES in |NEW FILES in |⭐"

# Week 2: Update download - only new episodes
# Same command - automatically skips existing files!
docker-compose exec gofile-dl curl -X POST http://localhost:2355/start \
  -d "url=https://gofile.io/d/abc123" \
  -d "incremental=true" \
  -d "folder_pattern=⭐NEW FILES in |NEW FILES in |⭐"
```

### Configuration Notes

- Tracking files are stored in `/config` directory - **ensure this volume is mounted** in your docker-compose.yml
- Delete the tracking file `.gofile_tracker_<contentId>.json` to force a complete re-download
- The tracking is per content ID, so different GoFile folders are tracked separately
- Progress shown in the UI is per-subfolder, allowing you to see which folder is currently being processed
